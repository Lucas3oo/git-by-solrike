# Git by Solrike

Adds popular Git commands in context menus in the Explorer and Java projects views in Visual studio code. 
For those that miss context menu items from Eclipse.

## Features

The explorer context menu will have the following items when a file is selected:

* Compare with default branch - basically a `git diff main -- <path>`. 
* Compare with HEAD revision - basically a `git diff <path>`.
* Replace with HEAD revision - basically a `git checkout`.

Those commands are also available from the command palette.

The context menu in the "Java projects" will also have the menu items.
