# Git by Solrike

Adds popular Git commands in context menus in the Explorer and Java projects views in Visual studio code. 
For those that miss context menu items from Eclipse.

## Features

The explorer context menu will have two additional items when a file is selected:

* Replace with HEAD revision - basically a `git checkout`
* Compare with HEAD revision - basically a `git diff` 

Those commands are also available from the command palette.

The context menu in the "Java projects" will also have the two menu items.
