# Git by Solrike

Visual studio code Git extension for explorer context menu for popular commands like 'Replace with HEAD revision'/'Discard Changes' and 'Compare with HEAD revision'/'Open Changes'

For those that miss context menu items from Eclipse.

## Features

The explorer context menu will have two additional items:

* Replace with HEAD revision - basically a `git checkout`
* Compare with HEAD revision - basically a `git diff` 

Those commands are also available from the command palette.
